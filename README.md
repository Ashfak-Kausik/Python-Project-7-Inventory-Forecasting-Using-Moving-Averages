# Python-Project-7-Inventory-Forecasting-Using-Moving-Averages
Developing a Python program to forecast future inventory needs using moving averages based on historical demand data.

Objectives:
1. Implementing a simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) to forecast future inventory needs.
2. Plotting the actual and forecasted demand.

Design and Approach:
1. Using historical demand data.
2. Implementing SMA and EMA calculations.
3. Visualizing the actual vs. forecasted data.
